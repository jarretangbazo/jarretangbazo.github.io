## Introduction

Urban energy demand in Africa is growing at an unprecedented rate. With cities like Lagos, Nairobi, and Accra expanding rapidly, accurate forecasting becomes crucial for infrastructure planning.

## Methodology

I used time series analysis with ARIMA models combined with machine learning approaches to account for:

- Population growth trends
- Economic development indicators  
- Seasonal variations
- Infrastructure development timelines

## Key Findings

1. **15-20% annual growth** in energy demand across major urban centers
2. **Peak demand shifts** correlate with economic activity patterns
3. **Renewable integration** potential higher than previously estimated

## Conclusion

Accurate forecasting enables better investment decisions and sustainable infrastructure development.
