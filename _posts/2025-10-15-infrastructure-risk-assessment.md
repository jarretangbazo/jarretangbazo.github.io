## The Infrastructure Challenge in Africa

Africa faces a significant infrastructure deficit, with an estimated $100 billion annual funding gap. Traditional risk assessment methods often fail to capture the unique challenges of African markets.

## Project Risk Factors

African infrastructure projects face distinctive risks:

- **Political stability** and regulatory changes
- **Currency volatility** and inflation risks
- **Climate impacts** and environmental factors
- **Local capacity** and skills availability

## Machine Learning Approach

I developed an ensemble model combining multiple algorithms:

### Feature Engineering
- Historical project performance data
- Macro-economic indicators
- Political stability indices
- Environmental risk scores

### Model Architecture
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Ensemble model combining multiple classifiers
models = {
    'random_forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    'gradient_boost': GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
}

# Cross-validation for model evaluation
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    print(f"{name} accuracy: {scores.mean():.3f}")
```

## Results and Impact
The model achieved **87% accuracy** in predicting project success, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Key applications include:

- **Investment due diligence** enhancement
- **Risk-based pricing** for project finance
- **Portfolio optimization** for development banks
- **Early warning systems** for project monitoring

## Future Directions
Ongoing work includes integrating real-time data streams and developing regional-specific models for different African markets.
